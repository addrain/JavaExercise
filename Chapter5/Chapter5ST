1. Show two ways to declare a one-dimensional array of 12 doubles.
    double[] dArr = new double[12];

    double dArr[];
    dArr = new double[12];

2. Show how to initialize a one-dimensional array of integers to the values 1 through 5.
    int arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

3. Write a program that uses an array to find the average of 10 doubles.
    double dArr[] = new double[10];
    // ...
    double x = 0.0;
    for(x : darr) x += x;
    double avg = x/dArr.length;

4. Cange the sort in Try Thiss 5-1 so that it sorts an arary of strings. Demonstrate that it works.


5. What is the difference between the String methods indexOf() and lastIndexOf()?
    indexOf() returns the index at the beginning of the substring.
    lastIndexOf() returns the last index of the substring.

6. Since all strings are objects of type String, show how you can call the length() and charAt() methods on this string literal: "I like Java".
    String str = new String("I like Java");
    String str1 = "I like Java"; 

    int length = str.length();  //returns 11
    char ch = str.charAt(0);    //returns 'I'

7. Expanding on the Encode cipher class, modify it so that it uses an eight-character string as the key.


8. Can the bitwise operators be applied to the double type?
    No

9. Show how this sequence can be rewritten using the ? operator.
    if(x < 0) y = 10;
    else y = 20;

    y = x < 0 ? 10 : 20;
10. In the following fragment, is the & a bitwise or logical operator? Why?
    boolean a, b;
    // ...
    if(a & b) ...

    logical because we're dealing with booleans.

11. Is it an error to overrun the end of an array?  Is it an error to index an array with a negative value?
    It is an error for both.

12. What is the unsigned right-shift operator?
    >>> It will shift all bits to the right while filling from the left zeroes, no matter if the number was negative or not.

13. Rewrite the MinMax class shown earlier in this chapter so that it uses a for-each style for loop.

14. Can the for loops that perform sorting in the Bubble class shown in Try This 5-1 be converted into for-each style loops? If not, why not?

15. Can a String control a switch statement?
    Yes.
