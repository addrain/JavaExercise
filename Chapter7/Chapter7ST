1. Does a superclass have access to the members of a subclass? Does a subclass have access to the members of a superclass?
    No, yes
2. Create a subclass of TwoDShape called Circle. Include an area() method that computes the area of the circle and a constructor that uses ssuper to initialize the TwoDShape portion.
    class Circle extends TwoDShape {
        Circle(int i, int j) {
            super(i, j);
        }
        double area(){
            return <area> //area formula for a circle
        }
    }
3. How do you preven a subclass from having access to a member of a superclass?
    using private access modifier
4. Describe the purpose and use of the two versions of super dsecribed in this chapter
    super(<parameters>) is used to access the superclass's constructor.
    super.<method> is used to use a method in the superclass that was overridden in the subclass
5. Given teh following hierarchy:
    class Alpha { ... }
    class Beta extends Alpha { ... }
    class Gamma extends Beta { ... }
   In what order do teh constructors for these classees complete their execution when a Gamma object is instantiated?
   Alpha > Beta > Gamma
6. A superclass reference can refer to a subclass object. Explain why this is important as it relates to method overriding.
    A superclass can refer to a subclass object along with referring the the subclass's methods and the subclass's overriding methods
7. What is an abstract class?
    A class with one or more abstract methods.  They are incomplete classes that depend on the subclass to complete the abstract method.
8. How do you prevent a method from being overridden? How do you prevent a class from being inherited?
    Use final before the method or use final before the class
9. Explain how inheritance, method overriding, and abstract classes are used to support polymorphism.
    Inheritance, overriding, and abstract classes are used to support polymorphism by being able to implement once and use many different ways.
10. What class is as superclass of every other class?
    The Object class
11. A class that contains a tleast one abstract method must, itself , be declared abstract. True/False?
    TRUE
12. What keyword is used to create a named constant?
    final
